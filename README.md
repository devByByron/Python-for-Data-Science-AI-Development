# Python-for-Data-Science-AI-Development



**Users of Python**

Widely used in data science, AI and machine learning, web development, and IoT devices (e.g., Raspberry Pi).

Popular among beginners (clear, readable syntax, large community, extensive documentation).

Experienced programmers benefit from writing less code for the same programs.

Large organizations using Python include IBM, Google, NASA, Facebook, Amazon, Instagram, Spotify, Reddit, Wikipedia, Yahoo!, CERN.

**Popularity & Adoption**

2019 Kaggle Survey: ~75% of 10,000+ data science respondents use Python regularly.

Glassdoor 2019: 75%+ of data science job postings mention Python.

Over 80% of data professionals worldwide use Python.

**Benefits of Python**

High-level, general-purpose programming language.

Large standard library supporting tasks like:

Databases

Automation

Web scraping

Text and image processing

Machine learning

Data analytics

**Data science libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

**AI/ML libraries**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Keras, Scikit-learn

**Natural Language Processing (NLP)**: NLTK

Clear, readable syntax and fewer lines of code for complex programs.

**Diversity & Inclusion Efforts**

Python Software Foundation maintains a code of conduct promoting safety and inclusion.

PyLadies: international mentorship group focused on empowering women in the Python community.

Python has a well-documented history of supporting diversity and inclusion in tech.

**Introduction to Jupyter**
**Overview**

Jupyter is a versatile web application for creating and sharing documents that combine code, visualizations, and narrative text.

Particularly useful for data science projects.

**Key Features**

Interactive Computing: Write and execute code interactively with immediate feedback.

Support for Multiple Languages: Initially for Python, now supports many languages, broadening its applications.

**Jupyter in Data Science**

Integration with Libraries: Works seamlessly with NumPy and Pandas for data manipulation and analysis.

Collaboration and Sharing: Notebooks can be easily shared to promote teamwork and knowledge exchange.

**Getting Started**

User-Friendly Interface: Easy to set up and use, helping learners leverage its features for data science projects.
